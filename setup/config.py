# Description:  The guild_config object contains information about each of the guilds using Stoplight-Bot.
#               If not configured, it uses the default settings.
# Access Keys:  Guilds added to this object should use the guild's Discord ID (no quotes) as a key.
# Identity:     You can customize non-Stoplight-related responses in "personalization.py".
# Placeholders: Phrases can be included in "message" and "admin_message" to link various Discord entities.
#               @USER will link to the message's original author.
#               #CHANNEL will link to the original message's channel.
#               #ADMIN_CHANNEL will link to the channel specified under "admin_channel".
#               !MODERATOR_ROLE will tag the role specified under "moderator_role".
# Emojis:       Non-animated custom emojis should be formatted as follows: <:EMOJI_NAME:EMOJI_ID>
#               To get a custom emoji's ID, right-click on the emoji, select "Copy Link", open it in your
#               browser. The ID is the long number between the  "/" and the image file extension (ex: .jpg, .gif).
